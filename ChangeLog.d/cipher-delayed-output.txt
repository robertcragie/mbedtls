API changes
   * For multi-part AEAD operations with the cipher module, calling
     mbedtls_cipher_finish() is now mandatory. Previously the documentation
     was unclear on this point, and this function happened to never do
     anything with the currently implemented AEADs, so in practice it was
     possible to skip calling it, which is no longer supported.
