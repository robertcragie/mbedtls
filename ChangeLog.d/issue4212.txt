API changes
   * In modules that implement cryptographic hash functions, many functions
     mbedtls_xxx() now return int instead of void, and the corresponding
     function mbedtls_xxx_ret() which was identical except for returning int
     has been removed. This also concerns mbedtls_xxx_drbg_update(). See the
     migration guide for more information. Fixes #4212.
